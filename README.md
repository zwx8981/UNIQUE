# New! IQA-PyTorch implementation
[**IQA-PyTorch**](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch) supports UNIQUE now! Can be easily used as follows:

```bash
import pyiqa
model = pyiqa.create_metric('unique', as_loss=False)
score = model(img_path)
```

# UNIQUE
The codebase for  
[Uncertainty-aware blind image quality assessment in the laboratory and wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13983.pdf) (TIP2021) 
and  
[Learning to blindly assess image quality in the laboratory and wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00516.pdf) (ICIP2020)

# Prerequisite:
Python 3+  
PyTorch 1.4+  
Matlab  
Successfully tested on Ubuntu18.04, other OS (i.e., other Linux distributions, Windows) should also be ok.

# Usage
## Sampling image pairs from multiple databases
data_all.m  
## Combining the sampled pairs to form the training set
combine_train.m  
## Training on multiple databases for 10 sessions
```
python Main.py --train True --network basecnn --representation BCNN --ranking True --fidelity True --std_modeling True --std_loss True --margin 0.025 --batch_size 128 --batch_size2 32 --image_size 384 --max_epochs 3 --lr 1e-4 --decay_interval 3 --decay_ratio 0.1 --max_epochs2 12 
```
(As for ICIP version, set std_loss to False and sample pairs from TID2013 instead of KADID-10K.)
(For training with binary labels, set fidelity and std_modeling to False.)
## Output predicted quality scores and stds
```
python Main.py --train False --get_scores True
```
## Result analysis
Compute SRCC/PLCC after nonlinear mapping: result_analysis.m  
Compute fidelity loss: eval_fidelity.m

# A basic demo that predict the quality of single images.
```
python demo.py  
```
## Very important ! Make sure that the model has been appropriately set to eval mode !
